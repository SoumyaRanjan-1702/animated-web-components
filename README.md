# Animated Web Components

Content on the web is increasingly _less static_. However adding even simple animations can be repetitive and verbose. This library uses Web Components to provide animations to objects inside a page. Still in development, more will be added soon.

## Getting started

### Using NPM

In you project root
```bash
npm install @edvilme/animated-web-components
```

Then load the content in your html file
```html
<script src="./node_modules">
```
